# Electricity-Forcasting-In-England
In this project, we aim to forecast the total electricity demand of England based on past available
data. The forecast takes 6 rounds in total and we predicted the electricity demand for the following
day in each round. The data set we used for forecasting contains historical demand of electricity,
past data on temperature and sunshine duration, as well as ahead weather forecasts. The data is
recorded separately for three regions in England, which are Bristol, London and Leeds. Through out
the forecasting process, we tried out different approaches such as ARIMA and regression models,
and continuously refined the models according to relevant statistical measures. In this report, we
will step by step discuss the data analyzing and model fitting processes in each round and the
refinements we have made with the models, also, we will address the difficulties encountered in the
project.
